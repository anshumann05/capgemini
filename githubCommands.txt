git config --global user.name "anshumann05"
git config --global user.email "anshuman.sh05@gmail.com"
git init
git add <file1> <file2>
git commit -m "some message"

<!-- this step is used just for the first time -->
git remote add origin https://github.com/anshumann05/capgemini.git
git remote -v
<!-- this step will be used every time a new commit will be done -->
git push -u origin master


using ssh:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "anshuman.sh05@gmail.com"
keep in mind the path where keygen will be stored
for extra security enter any phrase
key will be generated to the directory--> go to that directory --> copy everything
now to github --> profile --> ssh --> paste the key

now call command : 
ssh -T git@github.com


1. Download and install the Git command line extension. Once downloaded and installed, set up Git LFS and its respective hooks by running:

	git lfs install
	You'll need to run this in your repository directory, once per repository.

2. Select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

	git lfs track "*.psd"
	Make sure .gitattributes is tracked

	git add .gitattributes
3. There is no step three. Just commit and push to GitHub as you normally would.

	git add file.psd
	git commit -m "Add design file"
	git push origin master
